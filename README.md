rdf-InContext
=============

InContext let's you navigate through RDF relations in a smooth and understandable way. The objects in an enhanced publication are presented nice and clean like one reads a news paper to discover interesting material, and click on it to read details. The visualiser is playful, friendly interfaced, usable and creates information scent for more discovery of information.
